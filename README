Quine Mccluskey Algorithm
========================================
Sources:
---------
main.cpp
minterm.cc

headers(self-developed )
-------
minterm.h




OS COMPATIBILITY
-----------------

all unix systems, no Windows OS supported, but can be built using the source code provided.




Instructions to run and test the program:
-----------------------------------------

1) Run make all to compile and create the qm executable
2) Run the executable ./qm <filename>

or


1) Change the permissions for the 'execute.sh' script by entering the following command in the terminal, chmod +x execute.sh
2) now execute the shell script, './execute.sh', this script will do everything for you. 





Input file type
----------------
<filename> must be replaced with an input text file of the following format:
4   // NO. OF VARIABLES
6   // NO. OF INPUTS
0001 1
0010 1
0011 1
0110 1
0111 1
1011 1

the inputs in the main program has to be given in binary numbers, and 0 or 1 is added after each number with a space where, 0 denotes don't care values and 1 denotes normal values.

Compiler
---------

make sure your Operating System has a supporting compiler installed in it.

Compiler used - g++



Additional Notes:
------------------------------------------
1) To clean up all the output files, run make clean



How the Program works
-----------------------

The Program is built on the Quine-McCluskey Algorithm, the main Algorihm Minimizer program takes its input as text files with the attributes discussed above.
A program has been added which converts the decimal numbers to binary numbers and supplies them to the main program as a text file, named "tcase.txt".

The main program is well commented for each functions and methods, whereas the "minterm.cc" is used for the class creation for the minterms and is also well commented.

The "minterm.h" acts as the header file and important functions for comparison in the table has been declared there. 
All the codes are well commented and indented.
